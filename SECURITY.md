# Security Guidelines for Crypto Influence Platform

## Overview

This document outlines security best practices for the Crypto Influence platform development team. Following these guidelines will help ensure that sensitive information is properly protected and not exposed in the codebase.

## Environment Variables

### General Guidelines

- **Never hardcode secrets** in source code, configuration files, or documentation
- **Always use environment variables** for sensitive information such as:
  - API keys
  - Database credentials
  - Webhook URLs
  - Authentication tokens
- **Document all environment variables** in `.env.example` files with placeholder values
- **Add `.env` files to `.gitignore`** to prevent accidental commits of actual credentials

### Environment Variable Patterns

- **Next.js applications**: Use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` for client-side variables
- **Vite applications**: Use `import.meta.env.VITE_*` for client-side variables
- **Server-side only**: Use non-prefixed variables for server-side only secrets

## Database Security

- **Connection details** should never be committed to version control
- **Store database credentials** in environment variables
- **Share connection details** with team members through secure channels only
- **Use parameterised queries** to prevent SQL injection
- **Implement proper access controls** with least privilege principle

## API Security

- **API keys** must be stored in environment variables
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Validate all input** to prevent injection attacks
- **Use HTTPS** for all API communications
- **Implement proper authentication** for all API endpoints

## Code Review Security Checklist

When reviewing code, check for:

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Proper use of environment variables
- [ ] No sensitive information in logs or error messages
- [ ] Input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive details
- [ ] `.env.example` files updated with any new environment variables
- [ ] No sensitive information in comments or documentation

## Deployment Security

- **Use secure deployment pipelines** that handle secrets properly
- **Configure environment variables** in deployment platform settings
- **Rotate credentials** regularly
- **Monitor for security events** and suspicious activities
- **Implement proper access controls** for deployment environments

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not disclose publicly** or to unauthorised individuals
2. **Report immediately** to the security team
3. **Provide detailed information** about the vulnerability
4. **Do not exploit** the vulnerability beyond verification
